Yet Another Tech Mod

Because we can't have enough tech mods for minecraft.

## Introduction
This started as a simple project to fill some small gaps in my minecraft playing experience, as well as trying out some funny ideas.

## Features
Features listed are planned or implemented (if checked)

* [ ] Fluid Level Detector
  Emits a redstone signal when a valid fluid container is empty or filled

* [ ] Uranium Crystals (requires AE2)
  You can further refine Uranium into pure crystals for use in your Big Reactor

* [ ] Bauxite and Aluminum processing
  Possibly the largest feature I wish to add, the ability to mine bauxite and refine it into aluminium, recycling the red mud to extract even more ores.

## Credits
The Uranium items where all made from the Applied Energistics 2 Certus Quartz textures, so credit goes to the AE2 team for the original texture, I just made it green.
